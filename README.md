# Mina zkApp examples

This repository is a [fork](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/df993f9e097dbb466cce949380408d03b8450453) with multiple examples that introduce you to the development of Zero Knowledge Applications used by the [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/zkapps/) blockchain.

They employ the following libraries:

- Node 
- Typescript
- SnarkyJS
- zkApp CLI

If you would like to use a pre-built container with all these libraries, use the [Mina Developer Container](https://github.com/rhvall/MinaDevContainer) repository.

**_NOTE:_** The numeric notation in each example follows the [Mina documentation](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/tutorials) if you would like to see a step by step explanation of each sample.
